He dedicates his life to the quiet art of stone carving, rejecting cultivation, yet a looming cataclysm and the desperate pleas of his village force him to confront his inheritance. He begins to cultivate, but seeks a path *around* the brutal requirements, studying forgotten techniques and ancient lore.",
            "main_conflict": "Lin's internal struggle against the inherent darkness within his bloodline and the external pressure to conform to the established, ruthless methods of achieving power. He must contend with rival sects who view his unorthodox approach as weakness, and the creeping influence of the 'Stone Rot,' a spiritual affliction that consumes those who delay their full ascension, turning them into mindless, earth-bound entities.",
            "unique_twist": "The 'Stone Rot' isn't a disease, but a manifestation of the earth's grief. The constant, forceful extraction of energy by generations of Lin's ancestors has wounded the land, and the Rot is its attempt to reclaim what was stolen. Lin discovering this forces him to choose between saving himself and healing the world, potentially sacrificing his own cultivation."
